# DSN generator
Status: work in progress

Most of the DSN features are not implemented yet.

The DSN (DÃ©claration Sociale Nominative) is a French accounting standard.

It contains information that can be used to derive monthly indicators.

This software generates simplistic DSNs for testing purposes.

## Installation
`go mod tidy`

## Usage
For now, use it as a script: 
* edit the number of individuals you want in the DSN
* run `go run .`
